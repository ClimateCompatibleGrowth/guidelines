We describe why and how to publish a dataset on Zenodo. Before publishing your dataset, you may wish to read our guidelines on [organising] and [licensing] your dataset.

## What is Zenodo?

Zenodo is an online archive built and developed by researchers to ensure that everyone can join in Open Science. You can read more about Zenodo in this [presentation].

## Why should you publish a dataset on Zenodo?

Data deposited on Zenodo is findable, accessible and persistent.

#### Findable

Every deposit on Zenodo is described with metadata. This metadata is then indexed by search engines, such as [Google Data],
which allows users to find your data.

#### Accessible

Data on Zenodo is normally published under an open-license, which gives users explicit permissions and constraints on the use of the data. This allows re-use of the data.

#### Persistent

Every data set is provided with a digital object identifier (DOI) which uniquely identifies each version of the deposit on Zenodo. This can be used to cite the dataset and provides a single source of truth for related material, such as a paper which uses the data.

## Zenodo Community

Deposits on Zenodo are organised into communities. The Climate Compatible Growth project has a community which you can use to tag your deposit.

Upload your content [here](https://zenodo.org/deposit/new?c=ccg) to ensure your record is added to the community collection.
