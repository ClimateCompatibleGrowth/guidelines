Setting up the link between your source code repository on Github and your Zenodo account
means that your code is citable.

The process is documented in the [Github Documentation][1].

An automatic link between Github and Zenodo deposits the source code on Zenodo upon every Github Release.

Add a [citation file][2] in your Github repository to publish the citation alongside your code.
