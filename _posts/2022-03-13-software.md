Scientific software can be published openly to allow others to reproduce your work,
extend and build upon your code, and identify bugs or enhancements.

## Related Practices

You may be interested in the following relevant practices for scientific software.

### Release

When developing software, the code is a living document which is under constant development.
Because code under development is constantly changing,
it can be confusing for those who wish to use the software to reproduce a specific result.

A software release is a specific instance or distribution of a collection of source code or a compiled programme.
A software release points to a specific instance of the software.
A software release can be archived, cited and used to support reproducible research.
A software release supports many of the practices of Open Science.

### Version control

Many research teams that develop scientific software work with version control such as Git and Github.
A version control system tracks all the changes that you make and allows to also revert back to older versions. The version control system also allows for collaborative work as each contributor/author can create an own "branch" and develop new code. The new code can be reviewed and compared to the other developments and "merged" to the main branch if the new development is accepted. When the code is ready and tested it can be released.

### License

When releasing a software it is important to include a license from the very beginning.
There are many different licenses that may be appropriate.

### Metadata

Metadata is "data about the data" meaning that it describes the context, quality and condition of a e.g. dataset.
The motivation to use metadata in software are because they are machine readable, so the software release can be indexed (e.g. on PyPI, or Zenodo) which makes it [findable](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).
Metadata follow a different standard depending on where the software is released.

### Attribution

To make sure that the right people who has contributed to the software development are properly attributed one good practice is that the authors for each script can be added on the top of the file. If documentation software such as [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) is used then, if the metadata is added on the top of the file in a certain format, it will be added to the documentation file.
If the code is collaboratively developed on Github then each author that commits to the main branch will be added as a contributor to the code. If the code is [released](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) the contributors to the Github repository will be added as contributors/authors to that release.

## Example of scientific software - PyPSA

[The PyPSA-Eur: An Open Optimisation Model of the European Transmission System](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur) is a good example of how to manage scientific software.
The software is a workflow is written in Python and executed using Snakemake.
The source code is held under version control and publishing on Github under an open license.
Each release is deposited on Zenodo where it is ascribed a DOI.
In addition the software is documented in a short academic paper which is also archived as a pre-print in arxiv.
