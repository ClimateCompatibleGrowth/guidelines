# Why is attribution needed?
Academic authorship is highly valued since the most important output from a research project often 
is seen as a peer-reviewed article. The number of times your name is stated as first, middle, or last author 
can play a significant role in your future career. Furthermore, research is often a team effort 
but how do we decide who gets to be an author? What contributions to a project do not give the right to authorship? 
What about contributions from software engineers, undergraduate students, and technicians?
