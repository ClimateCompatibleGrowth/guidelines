As research moves towards larger teams of contributors, all the people involved in the collaborative process of research process must be acknowledged.

The [CRediT author statement][1] relies on the [Contributor Roles Taxonomy][2]
to clearly describe the range of personal contributions that a researcher brings to a collaborative project.
The statement helps define what authorship means in the case of scientific research,
by broadening the concept to include all intellectual and practical contributors to the final output.

For each contributor, the following basic personal information should then be provided:

- Name and Surname
- Affiliation
- [Open Researcher and Contributor ID][3] code
- CRediT role

[Brand et al. (2015)][2] define the [CRediT roles][2] as follows:

| Term | Definition|
| :--: | :-------- |
| Conceptualization | Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims|
| Methodology | Development or design of methodology; creation of models|
| Software | Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components|
| Validation | Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/ reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs |
| Formal analysis | Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyze or synthesize study data |
| Investigation | Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection |
| Resources | Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools |
| Data Curation | Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later reuse|
| Writing - Original Draft | Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation) |
| Writing - Review & Editing | Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision – including pre-or post-publication stages |
| Visualization | Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/ data presentation |
| Supervision | Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team |
| Project administration | Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution |
| Funding acquisition | Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication |
