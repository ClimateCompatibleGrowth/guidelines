Referencing is a formal process of acknowledging all sources of information or work from other authors that you used when creating any original material. Referencing consists of two parts: a citation and a reference. The citation is a note, a number, or an identifier of the source, within your work's text that acknowledges other authors' works in the relevant section. The reference expands on the citation and encompasses the source details that inform its location.
 
### Why is referencing important?
Referencing is essential in producing your original work or research. It gives the readers supporting evidence of how widely you reviewed the topic and how you support your arguments. It also provides the location of the sources you mentioned in your work; as a result, you help fellow researchers locate the cited references easily. 
Importantly, it helps avoid plagiarism by acknowledging other authors' work and ideas.

### What do you need to write a reference?
To add a reference, you need the bibliographic information of the source. Bibliographic information is the individual information used to describe and find a particular work, such as a book, journal article, or internet source. A reference should have four essential elements of bibliographic information: 1) the author or group of authors who created the work; 2) the year of publication; 3) title; and 4) where it was published. There are several ways of presenting the bibliographic information, known as "referencing style."

### Reference style.
There is a wide range of reference styles commonly used. Each style has its unique formatting guidelines. The selected style will depend on the requirements of a particular publication, such as books, magazines, or journal articles, to name a few. Also, the in-text citation will vary depending on the referencing style. The most common styles with simple examples for referencing are listed below.

### Reference for an image
Similar to journal articles and other types of publications that require referencing, images and figures need a reference to acknowledge the author. Each style has its unique formatting [guidelines](https://library.swtafe.edu.au/c.php?g=924083&p=6672159). Commonly, in-text citations for images should include the author and date. A reference should include author, date, title, format, publisher, and URL. 

However, the license in an image states whether attribution is required. This means acknowledging the original author. This is the case for images under Creative Commons licenses. These [licenses](https://creativecommons.org/choose/) indicate what you are allowed to do; for example, [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) states that you must give attribution. Under such a license, you can share and adapt the material. The figure below shows an example of how to reference or give credit. Notice, in the caption, the title, author, and license have particular links to locate the original work, the author's website/profile or otherwise, and license.

### Reference software and dataset
Often dataset and software are other sources and tools that have contributed to the research. As such, citing dataset and software help to support the **reproducibility** of your research, and it allows tracking the **reuse** of data and software. By referencing, you give credit and attribution to those who provided the dataset or developed software or apps. 

Style manuals can provide instructions regarding citations and references of software and data. Dataset providers, producers, and software developers can provide a recommended reference or supply an example (see examples 4 and 5).

Referencing software is an evolving area [(Jackson, n.d.)][2]. A general guideline is that you should include similar components as any other reference; see the examples below. Cite and reference any software used and have contributed to your research. It is unnecessary to reference software used daily, such as Microsoft Office; instead, the software that played a significant role in your research. 

>***General bibliographic information***
>
>Author/producer, date of publication/release year, dataset title, version, [subset used], publisher and/or distributor, access date, data locator/identifier(DOI or URL)

Commonly, citing and referencing software and the associated journal paper are standard practices. However, citing only the paper raise problems. One is that software can have versions or releases happening at different timescales. Second, sometimes there is no associated paper with the software; for example, in packages or libraries. A good practice is to cite and reference the specific software version and the associate paper. Examples for referencing software and dataset are listed below.

### Tools/Reference management software
Nowadays, adding and managing citations and references has become more practical by using automatic referencing management software. These tools can 1) save you time when adding and managing references, a process that can be time-consuming, and 2) allow you to format the references correctly according to a specific style.
Open tools exist in the pool of reference management software, and others require a commercial license. Selecting the programs/tools depends on your specific needs or can be influenced by choices adopted in your work team. Different management software is listed below.
