Referencing is a formal process of acknowledging all sources of information or work from other authors that you used when creating any original material. Referencing consists of two parts: a citation and a reference. The citation is a note, a number, or an identifier of the source, within your work's text that acknowledges other authors' works in the relevant section. The reference expands on the citation and encompasses the source details that inform its location.
 
### Why is referencing important?
Referencing is essential in producing your original work or research. It gives the readers supporting evidence of how widely you reviewed the topic and how you support your arguments. It also provides the location of the sources you mentioned in your work; as a result, you help fellow researchers locate the cited references easily. 
Importantly, it helps avoid plagiarism by acknowledging other authors' work and ideas.

### What do you need to write a reference?

To add a reference, you need the bibliographic information of the source. Bibliographic information is the individual information used to describe and find a particular work, such as a book, journal article, or internet source. A reference should have four essential elements of bibliographic information: 1) the author or group of authors who created the work; 2) the year of publication; 3) title; and 4) where it was published. There are several ways of presenting the bibliographic information, known as "referencing style."

### Reference style.
There is a wide range of reference styles commonly used. Each style has its unique formatting guidelines. The selected style will depend on the requirements of a particular publication, such as books, magazines, or journal articles, to name a few. Also, the in-text citation will vary depending on the referencing style. The most common styles with simple examples for referencing are listed below.

### Tools/Reference management software
Nowadays, adding and managing citations and references has become more practical by using automatic referencing management software. These tools can 1) save you time when adding and managing references, a process that can be time-consuming, and 2) allow you to format the references correctly according to a specific style.
Open tools exist in the pool of reference management software, and others require a commercial license. Selecting the programs/tools depends on your specific needs or can be influenced by choices adopted in your work team. Different management software is listed below.
